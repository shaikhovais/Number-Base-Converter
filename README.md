<----------------------------------------- Number Base Converter -------------------------------------------->

Created by : Shaikh Mohd Ovais Kadri

Project Description : -> In this project I have created a 'Converter' from which you can convert base of number from one form(Binary/Decimal/Octal/Hexadecimal) to another(Binary/Decimal/Octal/Hexadecimal).

Why this project was chosen ? -> This project was a complete new concept for me. To validate the input number with the base of input number required some thinking. I wanted to create a clean and a beautiful UI, which I was able to implement in this project.

How did you make this project ? -> Since it was a simple converter I was able to implement it on my own. To check if I am getting correct output, I cross-checked with the website 'https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/base-converter.html'.

What feature, technical aspects you had implemented ? -> 
I have used CSS grid to create the layout as I wanted. Buttons are given clean and beautiful look. The 'div' which show error is hidden initially, but when the input is incorrect then that div is visible with the error message. In swap I have used transform to give it a real look of swapping.
